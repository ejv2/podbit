# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Podbit runs on rolling release. You should always be using the lastest version, if possible. Minor and patch releases will mostly be used to roll out security fixes, so it is worth upgrading to them.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Plesae **do not** report security issues on the public issue tracker. Email them to the committer email of an appropriate maintainer.
This will most likely be <mailto:ethan@ejv2.cc>
