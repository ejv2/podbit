contrib - community and user contributed stuff
----------------------------------------------

The contents of this directory are optional extras which can be used alongside
podbit. These are intended for use by the end user and are not used as part of
the main program.

Patches in this directory are intended to be applied by the end user to modify
the behavior of the program or to add extra ones. They may be applied using the
standard UNIX patch command:

	patch -p1 <contrib/<PATCH NAME HERE>

or using `git am`:

	git am patches/<PATCH NAME HERE>

In the latter case, a new commit is automatically added into your working tree
which may make forks easier to maintain. Please remember to revert these when
contributing!

Scripts in this directory are useful macros and automation scripts which can
make using podbit alongside newsboat a little easier.
